/*

Fallback function is a special function available to a contract. It has following features âˆ’

    It is called when a non-existent function is called on the contract.

    It is required to be marked external.

    It has no name.

    It has no arguments

    It can not return any thing.

    It can be defined one per contract.

    If not marked payable, it will throw exception if contract receives plain ether without data.

Following example shows the concept of a fallback function per contract.
